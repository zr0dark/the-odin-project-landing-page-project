# The Odin Project - Landing Page Exercise

The goal of this project was to recreate a landing page using HTML and CSS from a reference landing page (see both screenshots below) for The Odin Project. Check out my code for this page in the associated folders. I've placed a screenshot of the reference image that we were supposed to use below so you can see how close I got it. Of course I personalized it a little and had fun with it!

Here's the reference image we had to use to create our HTML & CSS version.
