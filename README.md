# The Odin Project - Landing Page Exercise

The goal of this project was to recreate a landing page using HTML and CSS for The Odin Project. We had to use a screenshot of a reference layout that we were to create from scratch. Check out my code for this page in the associated folders. I've placed a screenshot of the reference image that we were supposed to use so you cans see how close I got it. Of course I personalized it a little and had fun with it!
